Previously these tedious operations had always been done by hand, and Kay was the first to make a machine to perform the work. Card-making machines did not, however, come into general use till 50 years later, when Amos Whittmore introduced an improved form. In Kay’s machine the card clothing, which consisted of cotton or linen cloth with a backing of leather, was fixed in two vertical stretching-frames, each capable of sliding vertically in an outer frame, which could move horizontally along the length of the bed. It is a duplex machine, two cards being simultaneously prepared, one in each frame. The main shaft is horizontal, and various cams, by which the following operations are performed, are fixed along its length at different points. The wire is led along parallel to the shaft, and the operations performed by the mechanism are :— (a) Feeding on a given length of wire. (b) Gripping the length of wire which has been fed on. (c) Pricking holes in the card clothing. (d) Cutting off a length of wire. (e) Bending it into a staple. (f) Pushing the staple forward and bending its legs to give the proper set. (g) Pushing the staple into its place in the cloth. (h) Moving the stretching-frame into position for the next staple. The first movement is performed by a jointed frame between two bars of which the wire passes, the arrangement being driven intermittently by a peg on the shaft, and the wire nipped during the forward motion. The holes are pricked in the cloth by piercers fixed at the ends of two levers which swing about joints below; they have a quick motion forward and then fall back again. The cutting is done by a shear blade moving over a plane face through which the wire passes. When forming the staple, the cut length of wire is held between an arm, which swings vertically at right angles to the main axis, and a steel spring. The arm is moved upward and enters a recess in the fixed cover plate just wide enough to admit the arm and the wire, so that the latter receives two short bends and becomes a staple. After this, a part of the arm which slides upon it is pushed forward and carries the staple with it, but the legs being caught in two inclined grooves at the side are bent and so receive the necessary set. Finally, the steel spring, which is thickened at the end, slides further forward than the rest of the sliding piece, and pushes the staple into its place in the cloth. The horizontal feed is given, after each staple has been inserted, by a lever which engages with a rack fixed to the stretching-frames. The vertical feed is given when the end of each row of staples is reached, an arm on the shaft striking a tooth on a star wheel fixed to a pinion which engages with the teeth of a vertical rack at the back of the frame.",,,"[{'name': 'John Kay', 'role': 'inventor'}, {'name': 'W.

There were two bands from a double-grooved flywheel, driven by a treadle and a crank, to two small pulleys of slightly different sizes, one fixed to the flier spindle, the other to the bobbin.

The spindles, of which there are eight, are provided with fliers which carry the thread round the bobbins and at the same time twist it, just as in the earlier machine.

This rail has eight plates projecting from it, through which eight spindles pass, and on these plates the bobbins rest.

The longitudinal, or warp, threads are wrapped round a roller at the back of the loom frame, from which each one passes through an eye in a separate vertical thread, or heald, and then between a grid or comb, called a reed, to a roller in front, known as the cloth-beam, upon which the fabric is wound up as it is woven. The healds of alternate warp threads are secured above and below to transverse bars, called heald-shafts, which can be moved vertically by treadles, and the healds of the intermediate warp threads are similarly controlled by another set of heald-shafts. By this means the alternate threads of the warp can be moved so as to leave a wedge-shaped space, called a shed, through which the shuttle, containing a supply of the transverse or weft thread, can be passed by hand. After each passage of the shuttle the healds are so moved as to reverse the relative positions of the two groups of warp threads, thus securing a complete interlacing of the two systems of thread; the weft thread is at the same time driven close up to the preceding thread by the reed, which is pulled forward to beat it up.

At one end of the shuttle race, in the reed frame, there is a grid between which the prongs can pass when the lay moves up. If the weft be unbroken, it lies across the grid and causes the fork to tilt up the hook, so that the oscillating notch does not catch. If the weft be broken, however, the prongs go through the grid and the hook is caught by the notch, so that the stopping lever is moved out of its notch and sprung to the end of its slot. The belt fork connected with the stopping lever throws the driving belt on to the loose pulley and at the same time applies a brake, so that the loom is stopped at once.

Beneath the table is a horizontal belt-driven shaft on which are three cams and a crank; one cam rocks a bell-crank lever that reciprocates the needle-bar in its vertical guides, another oscillates a shorter arm beneath the table and rocks a curved needle, while the third cam controls a swinging hook, also beneath the table, which acts as the hook in the chain-stitch machine. The crank works a four motion feed, while a helical sleeve encircling the upper needle-bar carries a hook that acts as a looper for the thread of the lower needle.

Sewing may be reversed and the length of stitch altered by means of a lever passing through a vertical slot near the flywheel. The inner end of the reversing lever carries a slide in which a stud, on the eccentric rod of the feeding arrangement, moves to and fro; the inclination of the slide being altered so that when the screw at the outer end of the reversing lever is at the bottom of the vertical slot the feeding plate under the needle is raised when it is moving away from the operator and the maximum length of forward stitch is then made.

40,,1860-11,Whole,N/A,CORD-COVERING MACHINE,donated,CORD-COVERING MACHINE,"This machine, patented by Mr. W. H. Zahn in 1855, is for wrapping the strands of a cotton cord with silk, and then laying the strands together into a finished ornamental cord of possibly four differently coloured strands. The machine is arranged vertically, with four bobbin frames projecting from a face plate, beneath which is a lantern ring that gears with a spur-wheel attached to each of the frames. Each frame carries two bobbins, a large vertical one holding the core material and a small horizontal one supplying the covering silk, which is in the form of sliver. Above the bobbin frames is a disc, that steadies them and also carries guide sheaves leading to the lay-top; above all is a return sheave round which the finished cord passes down to the winding-off rollers, which deliver it to a large reeling bobbin. If the cord is merely to be covered without stranding it together, the lantern ring is alone driven, so rotating the bobbin frames and winding the silk round the core, as delivered, the twisting so introduced not being objectionable. If the four cords so covered are required to be stranded together, the lantern ring is held stationary and the upper disc driven, so that, in addition to the covering action, the four cords are closed together into a rope.",,,"[{'name': 'J.
