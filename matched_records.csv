Object entry information: lightness of this flier permits of the very high speed of 8,000 rev. per min. for the spindles. An example of the modern ring frame is seen in No. 33.
Yarns intended for warps must be stronger than those for wefts and so are given more twist, while the looser wefts give the soft surface to the cloth. The various yarns are described by the spinners by their ""counts,"" thus: 60's means that 60 hanks of such yarn, each hank of the standard length of 840 yds., will weigh 1 lb. Double yarns are described thus: 60's 2, signifying that two single yarns, each of 60's count, have been combined in a single thread, so that 30 hanks of this thread would weigh 1 lb. The spinner's long measure is:—
54 inches = 1 thread.
80 threads = 1 lea or warp.
7 leas = 1 hank = 840 yards.
It is, however, often impossible to obtain the exact count desired, for, in 60's for example, there may be 51 fibres in the cross section, and one fibre more or less makes an alteration of more than one in the count. Hanks of various yarns are shown (see No. 3), labelled with the spinner's numbers, from 60's 2 to 240's 2. Weft yarns, having to be used in a shuttle, are wound up in small cops, while the warp material is usually twisted into skeins as shown. For certain purposes an exceptionally smooth surface is required and this is obtained by singeing off the ends of the fibres, by passing the yarn through a gas flame. This process raises the count somewhat; for instance, 90's may become 95's.

Object entry information: The cotton plant (natural order *Malvacea*, genus *Gossypium*) is widely distributed throughout the world between latitudes 40 degs. N. and 30 degs. S. It requires for its best development, as for its finest spinning, a moist and warm atmosphere. The fibre when matured becomes flattened, and has a helical twist amounting to as many turns as 180 to the inch. This is of great import- ance in the operations of spinning. The finer the fibre the more it is twisted, and the finer the yarn that can be spun from it.
The length of the fibre is called the staple, and in the case of the best cotton of all, that grown in South Carolina and known as Sea Island cotton, the staple sometimes reaches 2 in. The commercial value of a cotton is determined by its length, fineness, strength, pliability, smoothness, uniformity, colour, and cleanliness. Some varieties of cotton are best suited for spinning into twist or warp yarn—these have a hard strong fibre; weft yarns require a softer and more pliable fibre.
These specimens are representative of the different varieties of cotton grown throughout the world. Sea Island cotton has a staple 1.8 in., diam. 0.0006 in., will spin into yarn up to 400's counts (i.e., 400 hanks of yarn to the pound) and is suitable either for warp or weft. American cotton (Uplands, Texas, Memphis, etc.) is white, soft, pliable, fairly strong. Length 0.9 in. to 1.1 in., diam. 0.00076 in. The Uplands sub-variety is especially good for weft. West Indian cotton has a helical twist more perfectly developed than any other variety, but it is short in staple and rather harsh and dry, diam. 0.00077 in. It is only used for coarse yarns up to 40's. The supply from this source is rather small. Egyptian cotton has a staple 1.3 in., diam. 0.00071 in., will spin up to 150's counts and can be used either for warp or weft. Brazilian cotton (Pernams, Ceara, etc.) is rather harsh and dry but fairly strong. Staple 1.1 in. to 1.3 in., diam. 0.00077 in. It will spin up to 60's and is better suited for warp than for weft. Peruvian is of two principal kinds, the smooth is soft and flexible and easily spun; the rough is harsh and wiry and mixes well with wool. Staple 1.28 in., diam. 0.00077. It will mix up to 70's; the rough is suitable for warp

The press, patented by Mr. Eckel in 1860, has two vertical racks attached to the platen which, by pinion and spur gearing, are simultaneously moved, pawls and rack teeth preventing any running back. When the greatest pressure obtainable by this mechanism is reached, the crosshead carrying the gearing is pulled down by a connecting rod at each end, the other end of each rod enclosing an eccentric sheave; these eccentrics are driven by spur gearing, and so can pull the crosshead and platen downward through a short distance with very great power. Pawls engaging with racks in the side frames prevent the return motion of the platen, so that by this gear the platen is forced down successively by the space of one tooth for each revolution of the eccentrics.

Maker/Donor: Presented by Messrs. Lord Bros.
Date of creation: 1895
Object entry information: Presented by Messrs. Lord Bros., 1895. Plate I., No. 4. This is a model of a four-lap scutcher with a single beater. The adjacent photograph of the actual machine shows some details of the gearing that are not fully represented in the small model. The cotton, which has already been ginned and passed through an opener, is received by this machine in the form of rolled laps; these it has further to clean from seed, leaf, and other impurities, and to deliver in a very regular sheet. As many as four of these laps are supported on horizontal spindles, over a travelling apron upon which the ends of the laps rest. These are, by the apron, conveyed to a small fluted reed roller which delivers them into a chamber within which revolves a two-bladed beater, making 1,300 revs. per min. These blades pull off the cotton in small pieces as it is fed in, and throw it on a fine screen. At the upper end of the screen are two hollow revolving cylinders with finely perforated surfaces; their ends communicate with two air trunks from which air is continually being drawn by a fan arranged in the base of the machine. These air currents carry with them the dust and finer particles, but deposit the cotton on the surface of the cylinders, from which it is drawn off in two laps by a pair of rollers. The rollers compress them into a single lap, which is wound up on a cylinder resting upon two live cylinders with fluted surfaces. To obtain a cleaner and more regular product, two or more of these machines are generally employed, the cotton going through them successively before it is passed on to the carding engine. The scutcher represented cleans about 250 lbs. per hour, and requires about 4 indicated H.P. A very important feature in these machines is the “piano motion,” patented by Mr. Edward Lord in 1849, by which the speed at which the cotton is fed into the machine is automatically varied, so that the lap delivered shall be of uniform thickness notwithstanding any irregularities that may exist in the original lap. The arrangement consists in a number of levers, placed side by side on a common axis; the short end of each lever presses upon the feeding roller, and between these ends and the roller the cotton is fed. The thicker the cotton the greater the extent to which the lever is depressed, and the total motion of all the levers is proportional to the quantity of cotton being fed in at any instant. From the long arm of each lever hangs vertically a wedge, and between each wedge is an anti-friction ball, the whole series being kept in place by a channel that stretches across the machine. One end of the channel is solid, and the other end is closed by a bar that is connected with a fork that controls a belt running over a pair of opposite cone pulleys. These cones transmit the motion to the feed roller, and when the wedges lift, owing to thick portions of lap being fed in, the belt is shifted so as to diminish the velocity of feed, and thus secure a uniform deposit of cotton on the perforated drums, which are running at a constant speed.

Previously these tedious operations had always been done by hand, and Kay was the first to make a machine to perform the work. Card-making machines did not, however, come into general use till 50 years later, when Amos Whittmore introduced an improved form. In Kay’s machine the card clothing, which consisted of cotton or linen cloth with a backing of leather, was fixed in two vertical stretching-frames, each capable of sliding vertically in an outer frame, which could move horizontally along the length of the bed. It is a duplex machine, two cards being simultaneously prepared, one in each frame. The main shaft is horizontal, and various cams, by which the following operations are performed, are fixed along its length at different points. The wire is led along parallel to the shaft, and the operations performed by the mechanism are :— (a) Feeding on a given length of wire. (b) Gripping the length of wire which has been fed on. (c) Pricking holes in the card clothing. (d) Cutting off a length of wire. (e) Bending it into a staple. (f) Pushing the staple forward and bending its legs to give the proper set. (g) Pushing the staple into its place in the cloth. (h) Moving the stretching-frame into position for the next staple. The first movement is performed by a jointed frame between two bars of which the wire passes, the arrangement being driven intermittently by a peg on the shaft, and the wire nipped during the forward motion. The holes are pricked in the cloth by piercers fixed at the ends of two levers which swing about joints below; they have a quick motion forward and then fall back again. The cutting is done by a shear blade moving over a plane face through which the wire passes. When forming the staple, the cut length of wire is held between an arm, which swings vertically at right angles to the main axis, and a steel spring. The arm is moved upward and enters a recess in the fixed cover plate just wide enough to admit the arm and the wire, so that the latter receives two short bends and becomes a staple. After this, a part of the arm which slides upon it is pushed forward and carries the staple with it, but the legs being caught in two inclined grooves at the side are bent and so receive the necessary set. Finally, the steel spring, which is thickened at the end, slides further forward than the rest of the sliding piece, and pushes the staple into its place in the cloth.

It is used in the preparation of the materials for the higher counts of yarn, and finishes the work of the carding engine by laying out the fibres parallel and removing all dust and short fibres.

The lap to be combed is placed on the wooden rollers at the top of the machine, and is fed on to the combing cylinder by a pair of rollers which turn intermittently. The combing cylinder, which is as long as the width of lap treated, carries on its surface two sets of teeth arranged in rows, those coming first to the cotton being coarse, but gradually they become finer as the combing progresses.

Very fine yarns could be spun with these wheels, as fine as any which can be made with the machinery of the present day, but a great deal depended upon the skill of the spinner, and the output was very small. Cotton spun by such wheels had not sufficient strength for general use as warp thread, so that warps were usually spun from flax, but Arkwright’s machinery, by the greater twisting and consequent strength that it gave to the thread, rendered the use of cotton general for both warp and weft.","Inv. 1860-6. 21,220, L.S.","Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object entry information: set of teeth there is an interval of smooth cylinder, slightly sunk in, then a fluted segment and another smooth space, then the other set of combs, followed by another smooth space and a second fluted segment. The feeding rollers by their intermittent motion having delivered a certain length of lap slightly less than the length of the shortest fibre to be retained, a pair of nipper blades move together and hold the lap, while the teeth on the cylinder come out of the dust and shorter fibres. This being done, a top comb descends and holds the ends of the fibres, while the delivery rollers turn backward and bring up to these ends those of the fibres last combed, when a leather-covered roller descending presses them together and the delivery rollers turn forward and remove the combed cotton. The short fibres are meanwhile carried round by the combing cylinder, from which they are removed by a revolving brush at the back, and a slowly revolving doffer cylinder, with sharp wires projecting from its surface, takes them from the brush. A reciprocating comb strips the doffer cylinder and delivers this comber waste as a continuous fleece, which is wound in by the waste shaft at the back of the frame. The cycle of operations is completed twice in each revolution of the combing cylinder, which is driven continuously by a pinion on the driving axis. The feed rollers receive their intermittent motion from a pinwheel with two pins, on the axis of the cylinder, engaging with a wheel shaped like a Geneva stop, and giving to the feed rollers a slight rotation twice during each revolution of the cylinder. The nipper blades, that hold the fibres fed on for combing, are closed by the top blade moving downward and pressing against the turned-up lip of the lower blade. Motion is received through a lever, which carries the lower blade beneath its centre and is driven by a vertical rod moved up and down by a crank on a continuously-revolving shaft, running the length of the frame, and carrying several other cams. The delivery rollers are worked by a segmental rack oscillated by an arm, whose end works in a cam shaft, and the rack drives a pinion fixed on a shaft which can turn independently of the rollers. A leather-faced friction clutch, opened and closed by a cam on the cam shaft, couples the shaft so that the backing motion of the rollers takes place when the segmental rack is moving upward, and the combed cotton is delivered when it moves downward again. While the combing is going on the friction coupling is open, and when it ceases the friction cones close and the rollers turn back, and then, the ends of the fibres having been pieced up, they turn forward again and deliver the continuous fleece, at the same time drawing the lap for the next combing through the nippers. The sheet of combed cotton is now led through a small hole in the tin dish in front, and then taken through a pair of heavy rollers. The resulting slivers from each head are joined, and pass together through three pairs of rollers, and then through a trumpet-shaped tube to a pair of rollers delivering into a vertical cylindrical can carried on a revolving table. The doffer cylinder is revolved slowly and continuously by worm-gearing, driven by bevel wheels from the roller gear at the end of the frame. The machine shown is shorter than those generally used in cotton factories, having only two heads instead of the usual six or eight; accordingly, there are only two sets of operations going on at the same time and two laps being combed. The combing cylinder makes 60 revs. per min. while 120 nips are given, and a standard machine of eight heads will produce in one day of 10 hours from 100 to 130 lbs. of combed cotton. This machine is called a duplex comber because it goes through the cycle of operations twice for every revolution of the doffer cylinder.

Object entry information: The method of spinning cotton yarn on this machine was as follows:— Rovings, with a very slight amount of twist, wound on bobbins, were carried in a fixed creel beneath the carriage. They passed from the bobbins to the spindles between two wooden rails on the carriage, which could grip the rovings between them and release them when the carriage was moved out by the spinner. When sufficient length of roving had been unwound from the bobbins the wooden rails were closed up. The carriage, which had a traverse of about 6 ft., was then moved further out, giving a stretch to the roving. When the stretch had become as great as the roving would bear the wheel was turned by the spinner and the spindles thus driven by means of a band. This gave a twist to the threads and they were then strong enough to bear a further stretch, which was given to them by moving the carriage a little further out. When the stretch was sufficient the carriage was stopped and the wheel continued to turn until enough twist had been given to the threads. The carriage was then pulled in and the wire guided the yarn on to the spindles, which continued to turn and so to wind on the yarn, forming cops.
The spinning jenny led directly to Crompton's mule, but lacked most of the motions which enabled the latter machine to spin the finest counts and, when made automatic by Roberts, to survive without essential alteration until now.

In this machine the front rollers turn at three times the speed of the back pair, and the sliver is fed on from the back of the machine through a fork which travels to and fro continuously, guiding the sliver to different parts of the rollers. It receives its reciprocating motion from a crank pin on a pulley, turned by bands from the main driving drum, the axis of which is vertical. After passing through the drawing rollers the sliver is led down through a short tube to a pair of rollers attached to the top of a vertical can of conical shape. The can is driven by a band from the main drum, and on its axis is fixed a pulley, from which a band passes over guide pulleys to the pair of rollers on the can, so that they feed the cotton into the can at a definite speed, while the turning of the can puts into the sliver a slight twist.

Object entry information: This machine, made by Sir Richard Arkwright in 1769, shows his first application of drawing rollers to cotton spinning. The roving, wound upon bobbins placed at the back of the frame, was led successively through four pairs of rollers, each pair revolving more quickly than the preceding pair, so as to draw out the cotton to a finer thread. The bottom rollers are fluted and are geared together so as to give speeds in the ratios of 1 : 1·16 : 1·33 : 6·25, so that the last pair is rotated more than six times as fast as the first. Each roller is in four lengths, so that four threads were being prepared simultaneously for winding on the four spindles below. The upper rollers are covered with leather, and were pressed upon the lower ones by pulleys over which small lead weights were attached remain.

The rotation of the flier, carrying the thread with it, gave one turn of twist to the yarn for each revolution. The bobbin, under the pull of the yarn, rotated in the same direction as the flier, and if it went at the same speed would wind in no yarn. “The screwing of the band,” however, put a drag upon the bobbin, and it wound in yarn equivalent to the number of revolutions that it lagged behind the flier.

Object entry information: The method of spinning cotton yarn on this machine was as follows:— Rovings, with a very slight amount of twist, wound on bobbins, were carried in a fixed creel beneath the carriage. They passed from the bobbins to the spindles between two wooden rails on the carriage, which could grip the rovings between them and release them when the carriage was moved out by the spinner. When sufficient length of roving had been unwound from the bobbins the wooden rails were closed up. The carriage, which had a traverse of about 6 ft., was then moved further out, giving a stretch to the roving. When the stretch had become as great as the roving would bear the wheel was turned by the spinner and the spindles thus driven by means of a band. This gave a twist to the threads and they were then strong enough to bear a further stretch, which was given to them by moving the carriage a little further out. When the stretch was sufficient the carriage was stopped and the wheel continued to turn until enough twist had been given to the threads. The carriage was then pulled in and the wire guided the yarn on to the spindles, which continued to turn and so to wind on the yarn, forming cops.
The spinning jenny led directly to Crompton's mule, but lacked most of the motions which enabled the latter machine to spin the finest counts and, when made automatic by Roberts, to survive without essential alteration until now.

In this machine the front rollers turn at three times the speed of the back pair, and the sliver is fed on from the back of the machine through a fork which travels to and fro continuously, guiding the sliver to different parts of the rollers. It receives its reciprocating motion from a crank pin on a pulley, turned by bands from the main driving drum, the axis of which is vertical. After passing through the drawing rollers the sliver is led down through a short tube to a pair of rollers attached to the top of a vertical can of conical shape. The can is driven by a band from the main drum, and on its axis is fixed a pulley, from which a band passes over guide pulleys to the pair of rollers on the can, so that they feed the cotton into the can at a definite speed, while the turning of the can puts into the sliver a slight twist.

Date of creation: Replica presented 1912. (Invented between the years 1774 and 1779).
Object entry information: From the combination in this machine of Paul’s method of drawing out the roving by rollers and Hargreaves’s reciprocating carriage, it was called a mule. It was invented by Samuel Crompton of Bolton between the years 1774 and 1779 and called at first from the name of Crompton’s house, the Hall-i’-th’-Wood wheel, as well as the muslin wheel, from its ability to spin very fine yarn. The mule, essentially the same as Crompton made it, but now elaborated into what is probably the most beautiful of all mechanisms and made self-acting, is still the only means of spinning the finest yarns. The important principle is that the lengths of roving are held between the ends of the spindles and the front pair of rollers without strain, while the amount of twist necessary to give strength to the yarn is put into it by the revolution of the spindles. Hargreaves drew out the roving and twisted it at the same time in the outward movement of the carriage, and Arkwright used Paul’s roller method to draw out the roving, winding it on the spindle by a flyer arm; both of these processes put more stress on the thread than the finer counts would bear without breaking. The machine is arranged for working by hand, but there is a fast and loose pulley for driving by power, with a wooden lath to shift the fork. The handle on the spindle of the big rope pulley is turned in a contra-clockwise direction. From this axis by bevel gearing and an inclined shaft the rollers receive their motion. There are three pairs of rollers through which the rovings are drawn from bobbins which are held in a frame, not shown in this machine; the front pair revolve at three times the speed of the back pair and the middle pair are idle.

This is a measuring appliance, invented and made by Sir Richard Arkwright, for winding yarn into hanks of measured length and convenient for packing. As yarn is sold by weight the price depends largely upon the number of hanks that go to the pound—a quantity known as the “count” of the yarn (see p. 10)—and for determining the count this wrap reel is also most convenient. The reel consists of a six-armed star turning on a horizontal axis and rotated by a winch handle. From the axis reducing gearing transmits motion to an index moving over a horizontal circular dial, the reading on which indicates the length wound on. One revolution of the reel winds on 1·5 yd. of yarn and moves the index through $\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{00}\text{th}$ of the circle. The dial is divided into seven equal parts so that one division represents 80 turns of the reel or 120 yd., which makes one “lea” or “wrap.” Seven “wraps” make one “hank” or 840 yd., a quantity represented by the index having moved once round the dial. When reeling to find the count of the yarn, one wrap is wound off and weighed.

Object entry information: Thus the roving is drawn three times finer in passing through the rollers. The spindles are carried in a carriage which is moved to and fro on rails by means of two cords, one end of each of which is fixed to the carriage and the other to a helically grooved drum. The drum is rotated by spur gearing, having a speed ratio of 1 to 9, from the main driving shaft. A crossed rope from the big pulley drives a speed pulley which is carried on an arm, slotted for adjustment, bolted to the frame. From the speed pulley an endless rope passes once round a pulley fixed to a tin drum and round a fixed pulley at the other end of the frame. From the tin drum bands work on to wharves on the spindles. The speed pulley allows a varying amount of twist to be put into different qualities of yarn. The action was as follows:—A roving was fixed to each spindle and led off from its top end. The handle being rotated the rovings were delivered by the rollers and the carriage travelled from left to right at the same speed as the rollers delivered, the spindles at the same time rotating to twist the roving. This went on until a projection on the carriage came against the curved arm of a stop lever which caused the roller gearing to be put out of gear and so stopped delivery of rovings. The carriage then went on, stretching the length of yarn held between the spindles and rollers, and now strong enough by reason of the twist put into it to bear this strain, until the carriage came against another curved lever arm by means of which the helically grooved drum which traversed the carriage was put out of gear and so the carriage stopped. The spindles still went on turning, giving more twist and so shortening the length of yarn which was being spun; while this was going on the carriage received a slight receding motion to the left in order to avoid strain on the yarn.

Object entry information: Contributed by R. Bodmer, Esq., 1857. This is a model of J. G. Bodmer’s machine, patented in 1824, for treating the cotton after it has been scutched and formed into a lap; the leading idea of his process was to keep the slivers in the form of lap as long as possible before placing on bobbins. In this machine two laps are unrolled side by side and pass together through three pairs of drawing rollers, the last pair of which moves at about 12 times the linear speed of the first; then through a pair of pressing rollers which deliver it upon a travelling band. Upon this band are also delivered the slivers from 11 other heads, and the lot passes to a conductor along which it travels to the lap forming attachment, which is in duplicate. This conductor is pivoted near the end of the travelling band, and when a lap is completed at one side of the lap machine the conductor is slewed round so that it delivers the slivers to the other side; then the completed lap is removed, so that the running is continuous. The last set of rollers, through which each sliver passes before it reaches the travelling band, is placed obliquely so that each sliver as it comes off is delivered upon the band parallel with the others, without overlapping.

The several slivers of the lap are passed together through drawing rollers, by which their length is increased from 12 to 15 times; each passes through a separate hole in a horizontal guiding rail, and they are then wound together into a fresh lap or roll. As the extension greatly reduces the diameter of the slivers, they cannot form, after drawing, a lap of the original width; so, to close them together uniformly, the final lap is wound on a horizontal axis at right angles to that of the drawing rollers, an intermediate directing roller dividing the 90 deg. unequally. The guiding rail is reciprocated longitudinally by a double-grooved cylindrical cam, and to permit of the adjustment of the inclination of the directing roller it is driven by a universal joint. Mr. Bodmer intended to place 25 of these heads in one machine and to wind up the 200 slivers so treated in one roll, which was then to be sent on to the throstles or mules. To give strength to the roll, he wound in with the lap a cloth of equal width.",Inv. 1857-102,"Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Object entry information: Thus the roving is drawn three times finer in passing through the rollers. The spindles are carried in a carriage which is moved to and fro on rails by means of two cords, one end of each of which is fixed to the carriage and the other to a helically grooved drum. The drum is rotated by spur gearing, having a speed ratio of 1 to 9, from the main driving shaft. A crossed rope from the big pulley drives a speed pulley which is carried on an arm, slotted for adjustment, bolted to the frame. From the speed pulley an endless rope passes once round a pulley fixed to a tin drum and round a fixed pulley at the other end of the frame. From the tin drum bands work on to wharves on the spindles. The speed pulley allows a varying amount of twist to be put into different qualities of yarn. The action was as follows:—A roving was fixed to each spindle and led off from its top end. The handle being rotated the rovings were delivered by the rollers and the carriage travelled from left to right at the same speed as the rollers delivered, the spindles at the same time rotating to twist the roving. This went on until a projection on the carriage came against the curved arm of a stop lever which caused the roller gearing to be put out of gear and so stopped delivery of rovings. The carriage then went on, stretching the length of yarn held between the spindles and rollers, and now strong enough by reason of the twist put into it to bear this strain, until the carriage came against another curved lever arm by means of which the helically grooved drum which traversed the carriage was put out of gear and so the carriage stopped. The spindles still went on turning, giving more twist and so shortening the length of yarn which was being spun; while this was going on the carriage received a slight receding motion to the left in order to avoid strain on the yarn.

Object name: ORIGINAL WRAP REEL.
Maker/Donor: Invented and made by Sir Richard Arkwright
Date of creation: N/A
Object entry information: Received 1860. This is a measuring appliance, invented and made by Sir Richard Arkwright, for winding yarn into hanks of measured length and convenient for packing. As yarn is sold by weight the price depends largely upon the number of hanks that go to the pound—a quantity known as the “count” of the yarn (see p. 10)—and for determining the count this wrap reel is also most convenient. The reel consists of a six-armed star turning on a horizontal axis and rotated by a winch handle. From the axis reducing gearing transmits motion to an index moving over a horizontal circular dial, the reading on which indicates the length wound on. One revolution of the reel winds on 1·5 yd. of yarn and moves the index through $\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{00}\text{th}$ of the circle. The dial is divided into seven equal parts so that one division represents 80 turns of the reel or 120 yd., which makes one “lea” or “wrap.” Seven “wraps” make one “hank” or 840 yd., a quantity represented by the index having moved once round the dial. When reeling to find the count of the yarn, one wrap is wound off and weighed. As there are 7,000 gr. in a pound and seven wraps in a hank, the number or count of the yarn is obtained by dividing 1,000 by the weight of the measured wrap in grains.

Object entry information: Contributed by R. Bodmer, Esq., 1857. This is a model of J. G. Bodmer’s machine, patented in 1824, for treating the cotton after it has been scutched and formed into a lap; the leading idea of his process was to keep the slivers in the form of lap as long as possible before placing on bobbins. In this machine two laps are unrolled side by side and pass together through three pairs of drawing rollers, the last pair of which moves at about 12 times the linear speed of the first; then through a pair of pressing rollers which deliver it upon a travelling band. Upon this band are also delivered the slivers from 11 other heads, and the lot passes to a conductor along which it travels to the lap forming attachment, which is in duplicate. This conductor is pivoted near the end of the travelling band, and when a lap is completed at one side of the lap machine the conductor is slewed round so that it delivers the slivers to the other side; then the completed lap is removed, so that the running is continuous. The last set of rollers, through which each sliver passes before it reaches the travelling band, is placed obliquely so that each sliver as it comes off is delivered upon the band parallel with the others, without overlapping.

Object entry information: This is a machine for doubling cotton yarn to form thread for sewing or other purposes. It is similar to a throstle spinning frame, but is without drawing rollers, and is arranged for spinning two yarns into one thread. The cops containing the yarn are placed in the creel along the centre of the frame, and the yarn for each spindle is led down underneath a glass rod in a trough of water, and between a pair of brass rollers, to a flier fixed at the top of the vertical spindle. From the flier it passes to a bobbin loose upon the spindle, and as the flier rotates it twists the two yarns together, and at the same time winds them on to the bobbin. As the rollers do not feed out the yarn as fast as the flier would wind it on a fixed bobbin, the difference is made up by the bobbin slipping round under the pull of the yarn. The bobbins rest upon a rail which is raised and lowered by heart cams placed below the machine, so winding the thread uniformly on the whole length of each bobbin. A feature of this machine is the extent to which frictional driving is employed. From the main central shaft two parallel shafts are driven by leather-covered pulleys, and each of these shafts has on it 24 metal discs or friction cones, each driving a leather-covered conical pulley, formed on the base of a flier spindle, no cords or belts being used. The rollers are, however, connected by positive gearing with the driving shaft.

The wet washed wool is fed on to the travelling feed apron of the machine, and enters the first compartment through a pair of rollers and is carried forward over a specially shaped plate or bridge by an upward current of air set in motion by a fan which runs at 1,350 revolutions per minute, and is heated by steam in a tubular heater. The damp air passes out of the compartment through a perforated plate at the top. Short fibre, small particles of dirt, and fine kemps, blown through the perforations, collect on the upper surface of the plate and are removed by hand. From the last three or four compartments the hot air, which now contains little moisture, is collected and taken back into the fan chamber. The temperature in the compartments can be varied to suit different kinds of wool by means of a slide valve which regulates the amount of air admitted. Drying is effected in from 1 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes, and the output of the machine is about 400 lb. per hour. A framed diagram which is exhibited near this model shews how the machine works.]

Maker/Donor: [Messrs. J. and W. McNaught]
Date of creation: [1914]
Object entry information: [The machine represented by this model is one of a series of four through which the wool is passed in order to separate from it the impurities which consist of Yolk, or wool fat, Suint, or sheep's perspiration, and dirt. Yolk is insoluble in water and does not form soluble soaps with alkalies, but it emulsifies, and the washing process is based on this property. An inner tank with a perforated bottom is fixed inside a large tank. The inner tank holds the wool, which is propelled and agitated by a number of bars of brass prongs fixed to two long tubes which are lowered into the sud and then moved forward a short distance by means of cranks, cams, and levers. The forks at the delivery end of the machine are shortened and carry the wool over a chute and between rollers on to an apron which transfers it to the second machine in the series, and so on. The first machine has a bowl, or tank, 30 ft. long, the second 24 ft. long, the third 18 ft. long, and the fourth 12 ft. long. The liquor in the washing bowls consists of water heated up to a temperature of about 120 deg. F., with soap and sodium or potassium carbonate; but the fourth bowl usually contains hot water only, to rinse the wool. The fats rise to the top and are carried at the delivery end into a third or settling tank, from which they are flushed and from which the liquor is pumped from a point near the middle of this tank back into the washing bowl. The dirt falls through the perforations of the inner tank and is collected from one side of the bottom of the outer bowl, which is inclined. The propelling forks make from 15 to 18 strokes per minute and the delivery rollers make 8 revolutions per minute. 1,000 to 1,200 lb. of greasy wool per hour can be dealt with by a set of four bowls with an expenditure of 10 h.p. A sectional drawing of the machine is exhibited near the model.]

Object name: BRAID LOOM.

Object entry information: This is an ornamental example of a loom for weaving by hand narrow fabrics such as braid and other trimmings. Such looms were used in Yorkshire in the latter half of the 18th century, and probably had their origin in Norway or Sweden. The warp is wound on a beam, which is turned by a handle and checked by a ratchet and pawl. Alternate sets of threads pass through 12 slots and 11 holes in a frame which can be lifted up. Lifting up the frame also lifts the warps which pass through the holes, and so a shed is formed. The weft is passed through the shed on the spool. A shed may be formed also by selecting certain warps and holding them up by means of one of the flat meshes, which may also be used for beating up. The woven material is kept taut by pinning it to the dress of the weaver.

Object name: MODEL OF VELVET LOOM. (Scale 1 : 8.)
Maker/Donor: Presented by Mrs. Reynolds.
Date of creation: 1907.
Object entry information: Plush or pile fabrics have a raised surface, which is produced by the introduction of threads in addition to the ordinary warp and weft forming the ground or body of the fabric. They are of various classes, depending upon whether the pile is caused by additional warp or by additional weft threads, and also upon whether the threads are cut or uncut. The model represents a hand loom for weaving velvet, in which material the pile is produced by a great number of short silk warp threads, the ends of which stand up closely enough together to conceal completely the structure of the ground. The warp for the pile is carried upon an additional beam placed above the ordinary one, and separate heald-shafts are provided for its threads. In operation, the latter are raised and depressed, together with one-half of the ordinary warp, until three picks have been completed, when a brass wire is inserted below the pile warp and above the whole of the ordinary warp. The pile warp and half of the ordinary one are then depressed, three more picks are executed, another wire inserted, and the process repeated. In this way the pile threads are made to form loops around the wires, which loops are cut through by means of a special form of knife known as a trevette, each wire being provided with a groove along its upper side to facilitate this process. Two wires only are used, the loops round the one being cut after the other has been inserted. The intermediate picks are well beaten up by a reed, so that when cut the pile threads are securely gripped by the weft. As many as 50 or 60 insertions of the wires are made per inch, and about six yards of pile warp are required for each yard of velvet produced. Smaller weights are employed on the pile warp beam

Object entry information: consists of two corresponding plates bolted together, and the plates are made in sections which form either an elevator or a depressor. The sections may be interchanged so as to work different patterns by a different sequence of these cams. There are usually as many sections as heald-shafts, and the tappet-shaft makes one revolution for each section of the tappet-plate ; in this example there are three sections, so the tappet-shaft makes one revolution for three of the crank-shaft.
Contrary to the present practice, the lay is supported by arms, or swords, from above, but it is driven by the usual cranks and connecting rods. The picking-stick is moved by the pull of a strap fixed to one arm of a bell-crank lever. The other arm of the lever is flattened, and is brought by the movement of the lay against an arm fixed to a shaft which is turned through an angle of 90 deg. every pick, so as to pick the shuttle from either side.
Both the letting-off and taking-up motions are of the ratchet-and-worm kind, but in the former there is a finger which presses against the warp beam and limits the motion of the pawl, so that the feed is corrected for the varying diameter of the roll. From the beam the warp passes over a spring-supported roller, so as to maintain the tension on the warp during shedding.

Object entry information: This is an example of an ordinary plain loom fitted for driving by power. Four tappets, on a shaft which turns at a quarter the speed of the crank-shaft, move the heald-shafts in the usual way ; with this arrangement a four-thread twill can be woven.
Between the crank-shaft and the tappet-shaft there is an intermediate one, upon which is a cam for actuating the picker that drives the shuttle. A small conical roller fixed to an arm on the lower part of a vertical shaft, whose upper end carries the picking-stick, is held in contact with the cam, and the edge of the latter is bevelled to suit the conical roller. The cam is so shaped as to give a quick swing to the picking-stick, which is connected by a leather strap with the picker that throws the shuttle.
To protect the warp if the shuttle does not box, there is a loose reed motion. The upper rib of the reed is held in a groove in the lay cap, so that it can turn when the lower rib moves backward. A bracket, fixed to a rod beneath the sole rib, running the whole length of the lay, supports a rail which bears against the lower rib. It is held there by a flat spring, pressing upon a finger fixed to the same rod. A lever, also fixed to this rod, carries a roller which runs on a bent spring, to keep the reed steady when the shuttle is passing. Should the shuttle stop in the shed, the lay when beating up swings the reed backward, the finger turns the bracket, and its point comes into contact with a roughened surface on the stop rod, which then pushes out of the notch and the belt is guided on to the loose pulley. In order that the reed may be quite firm whilst beating up, a curved arm fixed to the rod which carries the rail is so arranged that, when the shuttle has boxed and the reed is in its place, it shall be pressed upon by the lower surface of a chisel-edged piece fixed to the framing ; one of these arms is at each end of the lay.
The arrangement for stopping the loom if the weft should break is the usual weft fork and grid, described in connection with No. 70. The requisite tension on the warp is given by a rope coiled round the warp beam at each end and attached to a flat spring fixed to the loom frame. When weaving heavy cloth the ropes are connected with a lever acted upon by the lay at the time when the heald-shafts are being moved ; by this means the warp is slackened when the shed is opening, and tightened when it is closing. The cloth is wound up as it is woven, by a ratchet wheel and spur gearing driven from one of the swords. It is wound upon a roller whose ends rest upon those of weighted levers that keep the cloth roller in contact with the roughened roller. A self-acting temple keeps the cloth out to a uniform width ; it consists of a roller fluted at each end, one cut with a right-handed and the other with a left-handed helical groove.

Maker/Donor: Lent by the Royal Society of Arts.
Date of creation: 1867
Object entry information: This is a model of a plain calico loom, invented by G. White, of Glasgow, about 1829. Its chief features are that the shuttle is picked by springs which give a uniform throw, irrespective of the speed of the loom, and that the levers and cams are all driven from one shaft. From the driving shaft, motion is taken through a crank and connecting rod to an upright shaft, to which is keyed a horizontal arm with two rollers upon it. One of these causes an arm, centred below, to rock through a small angle, and so give motion to the healds; it also moves a long horizontal rod endways, thereby compressing springs which pick the shuttle. The other roller oscillates a frame connected with the lay, and so effects the beating up. The cloth is taken in by motion derived from a ratchet wheel, the pawl of which is worked from the horizontal arm which gives motion to the healds and lay. The movement of the pawl is controlled by a finger which presses upon the cloth beam, so that less motion is communicated to the beam as the diameter of the roll increases.

Object name: MODEL OF PROPOSED POWER LOOM. (Scale 1: 6.)
Maker/Donor: Presented by J. E. Hodgkin, Esq.
Date of creation: 1898
Object entry information: This form of loom was patented by Mr. S. C. Salisbury in 1860; it was tried on a practical scale with some success, but was ultimately abandoned. The chief features of the loom are the shape of the shuttle, and the method of driving it, whereby the beating-up motion of the lay is dispensed with. The shuttle is moved to and fro in the race by a roller, upon which it rests; this roller is carried on a frame that is reciprocated horizontally along guides by a pin projecting from the side of an endless belt, that passes over end pulleys, and is continually driven by power. The pin on the belt engages in a vertical slot in the reciprocating carriage, moving in the slot as it passes round the pulleys at the end reversals of its motion. The construction of the shuttle is better seen in the larger detached model of the same. It is supported and guided by friction rollers, while the spool of weft is carried sideways through the reed. The weft thread leaves the shuttle centrally at its front, and passes between grooved rollers which press it into the shed, thus avoiding the use of a beating-up motion for forcing the weft home. The headles, harness, and reed are of the usual construction, as are also the drums and rollers for the warp threads and for the finished yarn. The motions for all of these parts are, however, derived from a pair of connected levers that are moved by the reciprocating carriage at each end of its travel; from these levers the motion is transmitted by segmental gearing and the usual ratchet feed motions.

It can be seen in position in Nos. 59 and 62. This device is used in all plain looms at the present time, but for fancy looms, where several shuttles are used and several picks made from the same side consecutively, it does not give a sure means of stopping if any one of the shuttles breaks its weft. For such looms a weft fork is placed in the centre of the reed space. At one end of the fork there are prongs, and at the other end a hook; the fork is nearly balanced on a pin, the prong end being left lighter so that the hook tends to fall. The pin is fixed to a rod attached to a bracket on the stopping lever which, while the loom is running, is retained in a notch. A bell-crank lever, with its upper end notched so that it can catch the hooked end of the fork when both are at the same level, is oscillated by means of a cam on the tappet or picking-shaft. At one end of the shuttle race, in the reed frame, there is a grid between which the prongs can pass when the lay moves up. If the weft be unbroken, it lies across the grid and causes the fork to tilt up the hook, so that the oscillating notch does not catch. If the weft be broken, however, the prongs go through the grid and the hook is caught by the notch, so that the stopping lever is moved out of its notch and sprung to the end of its slot. The belt fork connected with the stopping lever throws the driving belt on to the loose pulley and at the same time applies a brake, so that the loom is stopped at once. The feature of Sibley's fork, patented in 1860, is the method of supporting it; with the object of reducing friction, and also taking up any slackness that may arise, the axis is carried between cone-centres.

Object entry information: This represents a modern plain loom for weaving calico, and is in complete working order with the unfinished work in position. In most respects it resembles the earlier examples, somewhat modified by accumulated experience, and its size is such as to show very clearly the general arrangement of a power loom.
To keep the warp threads taut during the interval when the shed is closed, the bar over which they pass from the warp-beam is given a swinging motion by a lever at its end rocked by a cam on the crank-shaft. The frictional resistance to the rotation of the warp-beam, required to keep the warp threads tight, is given by weighted chains passing round smooth pulleys, but is also increased by the large bearings provided. The temples, which secure uniformity in the width of the cloth, are carried on the beam by sliding guides fitted with springs. The finished cloth is wound in by a roughened roller round which it wraps through an arc of 240 deg. ; it then passes round a guide roller and is wound on to the finished cloth roller below. This roller is forced against the roughened roller by springs, so that it winds in the cloth at a uniform rate irrespective of its diameter. There is a weft fork that automatically stops the loom when the shuttle thread breaks or runs out, and on the back of each shuttle box is an arrangement of levers that stops the loom if the shuttle does not go completely home in either box. These automatic stoppages are made by a trip gear that, when anything is wrong, releases the starting lever from the driving position, which, under the action of a spring, throws the driving belt on to the loose pulley, at the same time applying a powerful brake to the crank-shaft, so as instantly to arrest the motion.

The model only makes a row of five meshes, but the actual looms were to be 3.5 ft. wide and to make 33 meshes in this width; the length of the net was unlimited. The loom has a series of warp threads, each passing through a separate curved tube carried on a swinging frame, while across the framing extends a race in which is a like number of mounted bobbins or shuttles which are simultaneously moved sideways by a handle. At the back is a swinging and sliding frame containing a series of hooks which is so manipulated by the operator as to crochet a knot in each of the warp threads, and through these knots the shuttle threads are passed.

Object name: WEFT FORK.
Maker/Donor: Presented by Thomas Sibley, Esq.

Object entry information: This is a detached example of a weft fork, which is part of an arrangement for stopping a loom if the weft should break. It can be seen in position in Nos. 59 and 62. This device is used in all plain looms at the present time, but for fancy looms, where several shuttles are used and several picks made from the same side consecutively, it does not give a sure means of stopping if any one of the shuttles breaks its weft. For such looms a weft fork is placed in the centre of the reed space.

Object entry information: At one end of the fork there are prongs, and at the other end a hook; the fork is nearly balanced on a pin, the prong end being left lighter so that the hook tends to fall. The pin is fixed to a rod attached to a bracket on the stopping lever which, while the loom is running, is retained in a notch. A bell-crank lever, with its upper end notched so that it can catch the hooked end of the fork when both are at the same level, is oscillated by means of a cam on the tappet or picking-shaft. At one end of the shuttle race, in the reed frame, there is a grid between which the prongs can pass when the lay moves up. If the weft be unbroken, it lies across the grid and causes the fork to tilt up the hook, so that the oscillating notch does not catch. If the weft be broken, however, the prongs go through the grid and the hook is caught by the notch, so that the stopping lever is moved out of its notch and sprung to the end of its slot. The belt fork connected with the stopping lever throws the driving belt on to the loose pulley and at the same time applies a brake, so that the loom is stopped at once. The feature of Sibley's fork, patented in 1860, is the method of supporting it; with the object of reducing friction, and also taking up any slackness that may arise, the axis is carried between cone-centres.

Object name: MODEL OF TEASING MILL. (Scale 1 : 8.)
Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: Received 1895.
Object entry information: Teasing is a process for raising a pile or nap on the surface of woollen cloth by scratching the material with teasels, which are prickly seed balls covered with minute hooks that open and loosen the uppermost fibres when drawn over the cloth. Originally the teasels were set in a frame which was rubbed over the cloth by two men, but by arranging them on a cylindrical drum a more convenient method was developed, that led to the construction of the teasing or gig-mill shown. The model was constructed more than a century ago in the West of England, whence the gig-mill was introduced into France in 1802-7 by State assistance. The mill has a large open horizontal drum, between the bars of which can be secured metal frames carrying teasel balls. The cloth is teased during its contact with the hollow drum while being wound from a roller above it to another below, and vice versa. The upper roller and the drum are directly connected by spur gearing, giving a linear speed to the teasels of about 18 times that of the cloth. The lower roller is driven by the drum through friction gearing only, the contact of which is controlled by a lever lever. Each roller is in two lengths, and is provided with a claw clutch, by which it may be released, and a friction brake. As the teasing must be repeatedly performed before the surface is finished, the cloth when all wound on to the lower roller is wound back again on to the upper roller, and so on, the direction of motion of the cloth being continually reversed, but, owing to the form of a teasel, the teasel cylinder must run continually in one direction only. This is arranged as follows: when winding on to the upper roller, the friction gear of the lower roller is open, the roller being simply retarded by its brakes; when winding on to the lower roller, this latter is driven by its friction gear, and the upper one, which is released by its clutches, is only retarded by its brakes, which are weighted to maintain the requisite tension on the cloth.

Flannels and woollen goods have always presented difficulties in washing, and the dolly-tub method had been considered preferable to any mechanical process. This machine is an elaboration of the dolly tub. Its action consists in the alternate pressure and suction of four cups which move up and down in a tub and come down in a different place each time. The power is transmitted through a horizontal shaft and a pair of bevel wheels at the top to a vertical shaft carrying a crank arm, in the outer end of which is socketed the upper end of an inclined spindle whose lower end turns in a spherical bearing centrally placed on the boss of the tub, which carries at the top a fixed horizontal bevel wheel gearing with another on the inclined spindle. Above the latter bevel wheel, fixed to the spindle, is a shoe on which are centred four rocking arms which carry, pivoted by shackles on their outer ends, the four cups or pressers. The rocking arms are held down by springs fixed to the shoe, so that when it meets with thicker fabric in the tub a presser adjusts itself to the resistance encountered. The number of teeth in the bevel wheel on the inclined spindle is thirteen, and that of the fixed central wheel is fifteen, so that the inclined spindle turns to the extent of two teeth on its own axis for each revolution of the crank arm, and the pressers come down in different parts of the tub each time. To provide against the sides of the tub being hit by the centrifugal tendency of the pressers the short vertical arms which carry them are connected by rods passing round the spindle. Only one such rod is shown in the model.

Bridson, is intended to wash and rinse calico in the piece, two lengths passing simultaneously several times through a tank, at the same time receiving a flapping motion to assist in the removal of impurities. At the top of the tank at one end are weighted feeding rollers from which the calico passes to guide rollers at the bottom of the tanks; it then passes horizontally to a revolving flat frame or wince, round and under which it passes to an upper guide roller, and finally to a pair of squeezing or drying rollers over the tank. The squeezing rollers and the two winces are all connected by gearing, so that a regular flapping motion can be maintained. The level of the water is varied to suit the work upon which the machine is engaged; for washing it is considered that the material should strike the surface of the water, while for use in dyeing continual immersion is recommended.

Date of creation: 1857.
Object entry information: This machine runs pieces of calico, whose ends have been stitched together into an endless length, repeatedly through dye liquor contained in a tank, so ensuring complete and uniform saturation. There are two long dye baths arranged in line, with a space between for mechanism; over each bath is a square horizontal revolving prism, and at the bottom of each bath are two rollers. The baths are divided into compartments by open partitions to keep the calico pieces separate, and centrally along the bottom of the tank runs a steam pipe for maintaining any desired temperature. Above one of the immersed rollers is a sloping shelf, on which the piece being dyed rests in a pile that is being continually added to at the top and drawn from at the bottom, a great length of fabric being thus under treatment in each tank.

Maker/Donor: N/A
Date of creation: Received 1875.
Object entry information: There are seven cases containing specimens of the wooden blocks used for printing chintz by hand, as used in England about the year 1800. Each block consists of a mahogany or oak base with a thin face of the more expensive boxwood. The pattern is drawn in reverse on the boxwood and then cut into it, but a small border pattern shown has been prepared by the use of brass pins. Block printing for textile fabrics with repeating patterns is now almost superseded by rotary printing from engraved copper rollers, such as are shown in No. 107.

Maker/Donor: Contributed by Messrs. Hoyle & Son.
Date of creation: 1857.
Object entry information: Two blocks and a portion of a metal stereotype are shown. The blocks are built up of soft wood at the back, where are provided recesses by which a firm hold can be obtained with one hand when using them for printing. At the corners are pins by which in a repeating pattern correct register is attained. The patterns are cut in small pieces of boxwood with which the block is faced, but fine lines and dots are rendered in metal tape or pins; in one case the pattern is outlined in copper tape, the solid portions being obtained by filling in the outlines with cement. In large patterns containing blotchwork the surfaces were often recessed and then filled in with felt, which readily took up the colour.

Object entry information: This is a model of a machine, patented in 1839 by Mr. Joseph Burch, for printing from blocks on textile fabrics or paper. The machine and a modified form of it (see No. 110) were first tried on a practical scale at Messrs. Crossley’s works at Halifax. The tapestry, carpet, or other material is wound on a roll that is well clear of the floor level; from the roll the carpet passes through a tension device and over a large drum, then over a printing table within the machine, and round another large drum. From this it returns at a lower level to a frame of 15 guide rollers, round which it passes with its printed surface always outward; by this exposure it is sufficiently dried to be wound in a finished state on the roller in the centre of the frame. The printing blocks, of which there are six in the model, are carried in frames which, by plate springs, are supported face downward on a large reciprocating frame, which travels in a direction at right angles to that of the carpet being printed. When either set of blocks is over the printing table the reciprocating frame stops and several spring pressers force the frames down under the action of a crank or toggle mechanism; the other set of blocks is at the same time over the inking tray, upon which, by similar pressers, the blocks are forced down-ward for inking; the printing pressers contain within them a trigger gear by which they are enabled to give a blow when down on the block. Within the machine is a large endless apron or blanket, which forms an elastic covering for the printing table and one which is being continually changed; with the blanket also passes an endless oilskin apron upon which the colour squeezed through the material being printed is deposited, and this apron is being continually washed and dried by an arrangement of guide rollers, etc., at one end of the machine. The fabric is advanced by a step motion given to the main drums, driven by a cam on the main shaft; a similar motion traverses the blanket and oilskin apron. The reciprocation of the carriage and most of the motions are derived from cams. By the arrangement of the blocks six different colours can be printed at the same time by this machine, or two pieces of fabric may be passed through the machine at once and receive different patterns, each of which contains three colours.

Hoyle & Son.,1857.,"This is a model of a single-cylinder calico-printing machine, and resembles the four or more cylinder machines now used. The pattern to be printed is engraved on a copper roller, which is inked or coloured by a roller that runs in a bath of colour and has its upper surface in contact with the printing roller; the excess colour is wiped from the revolving printing roller by a fixed steel blade that has a slight longitudinal reciprocation; this blade, called the colour doctor, wipes off all the ink except that in the engraved lines. The calico to be printed is on a roller near the machine, and its delivery is controlled by a friction brake which keeps it tight; it is stretched widthways by passing over two bars, the upper surfaces of which are grooved in opposite directions. The calico then passes under the platen cylinder that presses it upon the printing cylinder, the two cylinders being pressed powerfully together by the lever arrangement in which the bearings are carried. After printing, the calico passes upward and then horizontally over a series of steam-heated chests, then vertically downward in front of similar chests, then horizontally and vertically through a long course, during which the drying is sufficiently completed for the calico to be wound on a roller at the drying end of the machine. The cylinder is continually being wiped on its leaving surface by a second flexible blade, called the lint doctor, which frees it from any fibres deposited by the calico. An endless felt or blanket passes round the platen cylinder with the calico, and then round beneath the drying chests, returning backward by a circuitous course in which arrangements for taking up the stretch are provided. This blanket forms an elastic cushion for the calico while being printed; it also absorbs and carries away any excess colouring matter. The application of engraved copper cylinders to the printing of textile fabrics was patented in 1764 by Messrs. Fryer, Greenough and Newbery; the employment of the steel-strip doctor as here used was patented by Mr. T Bell in 1783.","Inv. 1857-106. 20,783, L.S.","Continuation from previous page: TRUE

Outside the apron is an under-cloth, which receives any excess of colour pressed through the drugget during printing; this under-cloth is on a roll at the bottom of the machine, controlled by a brake, and after passing with the apron over the table is wound on a similar roll above the end frame. The drugget to be printed is on a roll, from which it passes round tension bars and over the printing table; it is then carried by the apron to the end of the frame, where it is separated from the under-cloth and conveyed to a drying screen (not shown), and is finally wound in a finished state on the highest roller of the frame.

Object name: MODEL OF ROTARY PRINTING MACHINE FOR CALICO. (Scale 1:4.)
Maker/Donor: Contributed by Messrs. Hoyle & Son.
Date of creation: 1857.
Object entry information: This is a model of a single-cylinder calico-printing machine, and resembles the four or more cylinder machines now used. The pattern to be printed is engraved on a copper roller, which is inked or coloured by a roller that runs in a bath of colour and has its upper surface in contact with the printing roller; the excess colour is wiped from the revolving printing roller by a fixed steel blade that has a slight longitudinal reciprocation; this blade, called the colour doctor, wipes off all the ink except that in the engraved lines. The calico to be printed is on a roller near the machine, and its delivery is controlled by a friction brake which keeps it tight; it is stretched widthways by passing over two bars, the upper surfaces of which are grooved in opposite directions. The calico then passes under the platen cylinder that presses it upon the printing cylinder, the two cylinders being pressed powerfully together by the lever arrangement in which the bearings are carried. After printing, the calico passes upward and then horizontally over a series of steam-heated chests, then vertically downward in front of similar chests, then horizontally and vertically through a long course, during which the drying is sufficiently completed for the calico to be wound on a roller at the drying end of the machine. The cylinder is continually being wiped on its leaving surface by a second flexible blade, called the lint doctor, which frees it from any fibres deposited by the calico. An endless felt or blanket passes round the platen cylinder with the calico, and then round beneath the drying chests, returning backward by a circuitous course in which arrangements for taking up the stretch are provided. This blanket forms an elastic cushion for the calico while being printed; it also absorbs and carries away any excess colouring matter. The application of engraved copper cylinders to the printing of textile fabrics was patented in 1764 by Messrs. Fryer, Greenough and Newbery; the employment of the steel-strip doctor as here used was patented by Mr. T Bell in 1783.

Object entry information: This is an early example of the Howe machine made by Messrs. W. F. Thomas & Co. of Cheapside, who had purchased the British rights in Howe’s invention. The machine shown is No. 1231 and is in accordance with Mr. Thomas’s patent of 1853. The needle-bar is reciprocated in vertical guides by a lever actuated by a cam groove on the flywheel disc, and the shuttle carrier is reciprocated in its long horizontal guide by a similar cam. The feed is given by the presser-foot, which receives a scuffing motion from a pair of cams on the flywheel shaft. The thread tension is adjusted by a strap brake acting on the spindle to which the reel is secured. The flywheel shaft is at right angles to the operator, and this arrangement caused the use of a peculiar form of treadle motion in which the treadle bar resembles an inverted T. The shuttle bobbins were filled by the independent winder shown, which was attached to the table; the work table of the machine was formed by the small upper board.

It is a lock-stitch machine, and the shuttle, which is of the elongated form, is worked transversely by a carrier having on its side a V-shaped slot in which moves a crank pin attached to the underneath shaft. The needle motion is obtained from a crank pin on the upper shaft working in a V-shaped slot in the needle bar. The needle thread tension is adjusted by altering the extent to which the thread is coiled round a smooth wire, and the thread is held at the commencement of the downstroke by an additional tension put on by a cam at the back of the crank plate. The feed is of the wheel type, the feed wheel being moved intermittently by a band, worked by a rocking lever from a cam on the underneath shaft, a wooden brake block giving sufficient friction to prevent the backward motion of the feed wheel during the return of the band.

Object entry information: This double-thread chain-stitch machine, in which an oscillating needle is employed to feed the work, was patented by Mr. G. Whight in 1861. The upper thread is carried through the work by a needle and forms a loop below, through which a second needle, carrying the under thread, passes. The latter is caught by a hook and held aside, so that when the upper thread needle again descends, it passes through a loop of the under thread. By interlooping the upper and under threads in this manner a form of chain-stitch, wasteful in thread, is obtained. The upper needle-bar is connected with a disc crank at the end of a horizontal driving shaft and slides in a hinged guide below. An oscillating motion is thus imparted to it in addition to an up-and-down motion, and the oscillations, when the needle has perforated the work, give the feed motion. The length of the stitch can be varied by adjusting the position of the hinged guide, while the thread tension is obtained by placing the reel between centres, which can be forced together by a screw. Within a vertical arm there is a forked lever which receives a vibrating motion from cams on the main driving shaft, and in turn transmits its motion, by means of a pin and slot, to a horizontal lever below. The under thread needle is mounted upon this lever, which also carries a projecting piece operating the hook, the return motion of the latter being ensured by a spring. The winder for filling the bobbins is shown.

The light flat spring on the table, fitted with a small pulley, appears to have been a tension arrangement. The needle and shuttle are missing and their form is unknown.

Object entry information: This double-thread chain-stitch machine, in which an oscillating needle is employed to feed the work, was patented by Mr. G. Whight in 1861. The upper thread is carried through the work by a needle and forms a loop below, through which a second needle, carrying the under thread, passes. The latter is caught by a hook and held aside, so that when the upper thread needle again descends, it passes through a loop of the under thread. By interlooping the upper and under threads in this manner a form of chain-stitch, wasteful in thread, is obtained. The upper needle-bar is connected with a disc crank at the end of a horizontal driving shaft and slides in a hinged guide below. An oscillating motion is thus imparted to it in addition to an up-and-down motion, and the oscillations, when the needle has perforated the work, give the feed motion. The length of the stitch can be varied by adjusting the position of the hinged guide, while the thread tension is obtained by placing the reel between centres, which can be forced together by a screw. Within a vertical arm there is a forked lever which receives a vibrating motion from cams on the main driving shaft, and in turn transmits its motion, by means of a pin and slot, to a horizontal lever below. The under thread needle is mounted upon this lever, which also carries a projecting piece operating the hook, the return motion of the latter being ensured by a spring. The winder for filling the bobbins is shown.

Object entry information: This is an early form of machine, and has a very low arm carrying the presser-foot, while the needle, which is curved, is carried on a separate rocking arm and, being directly driven by a crank, has not a preliminary upward loop-forming motion. There is the usual toothed feeding surface projecting through the work-plate, and it receives its motion from a crank ; but the direction of feed is immediately reversible, the fulcrum of the feed lever being movable in a slot in the lever, by which arrangement also the rate of feed is varied ; this adjustment is made by a milled head at the side of the table.

Object entry information: Another contributed by Messrs. Newton, Wilson & Co., 1868. The earlier of these machines, shown with its work-table removed, was made by the Howe Sewing Machine Co. about 1867, while the other specimen is a slightly improved copy of it. In each machine the power is transmitted from a treadle wheel below (not shown) by a belt running over a small pulley on a horizontal shaft beneath the work-table, there being no spur gearing. At one end of this driving pulley is an eccentric which actuates a rod connected with an arm capable of being oscillated between centres and provided with an extension piece that serves as a needle-bar ; the needle is, consequently, of the curved variety, and there is no special loop-forming movement. The shuttle is of the cylindrical or disc type introduced by Mr. A. B. Wilson, and is carried in a revolving holder provided with a hook by which the loop in the needle thread is carried round the shuttle, so as to be locked by the lower thread ; there is a brush in contact with the revolving hook, to check the thread while being carried round. The shuttle hook is on the shaft of the driven pulley, and near it the flange of this pulley is so shaped as to form two cams, one of which gives the vertical movements to the feed bar while the other causes the horizontal reciprocations required to complete the motion ; the return portion of the horizontal reciprocation is given by a spring, and there is a cam beneath the table by which the length of stitch can be adjusted. The tail end of the revolving shaft

The needle is reciprocated by a needle driven by a cam in the face of the main driving wheel; another cam in this wheel moves horizontally a rod that terminates in a rack, gearing into a small pinion with its axis vertical, arranged beneath the table. This pinion turns to and fro a revolving hook enclosing a circular shuttle which, by the hook, is enabled to pass its thread through the loop formed in the needle thread. The small size of the lower arm enables the machine to work on portions of a boot that would otherwise be inaccessible. A cam on the main shaft vibrates a lever that gives a vertical motion to the presser-foot, and a similar cam and lever give a horizontal motion to this feed, so that the feed is given by the foot itself. The presser-foot and needle bar are contained in a cylindrical plug which can be turned within the sleeve holding it to the main casting, so that the direction of the feed can be continually changed without altering the position of the work. Some spare shuttle bobbins and a multiplying gearing for winding them are also shown.

Maker/Donor: Contributed by Messrs. Newton Wilson & Co.
Date of creation: 1868.
Object entry information: This is an early button-hole machine, manufactured in America in 1868. Beneath the table is a horizontal belt-driven shaft on which are three cams and a crank; one cam rocks a bell-crank lever that reciprocates the needle-bar in its vertical guides, another oscillates a shorter arm beneath the table and rocks a curved needle, while the third cam controls a swinging hook, also beneath the table, which acts as the hook in the chain-stitch machine. The crank works a four motion feed, while a helical sleeve encircling the upper needle-bar carries a hook that acts as a looper for the thread of the lower needle. In this way two chain-stitch machines are combined in one, and both sew round the cut button-hole.

Object entry information: In this machine the button-hole is cut by a die attached to a hammer, then the hole is sewn round by a needle, the motion of the work at the time being controlled by an external cam plate that agrees with the shape of the hole. There is a thick filling thread below and a thinner sewing thread which is interlocked with the needle thread, these two threads sewing over the cut edges and at the same time enclosing the filling thread. An inclined mirror is arranged to render the lower mechanism visible.

Object name: BUTTON-HOLE SEWING MACHINE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by the Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing Co.
Date of creation: 1891.
Object entry information: This is a machine for sewing round the edges of the material where a button-hole is required, and then cutting the hole. The work is placed on a movable plate and secured to it by a small rectangularly slotted frame, which covers the intended position for the button-hole and is held down by a spring. The needle and shuttle movements are the same as in the ordinary sewing machine of this type, but the feed motion given to the plate is quite different. The plate, carrying with it the work, receives three separate motions: a quick vibratory one at right angles to the hole to make the stitches, one along the length of the hole, and a third to move the work across when one side of the hole is completed so that the other side may be stitched. When the two connected rows of stitches have thus been inserted, a knife moves rapidly down and cuts the enclosed cloth, so completing the button-hole.

Object name: LOCK-STITCH SEWING MACHINE.
Maker/Donor: Lent by the Singer Sewing Machine Co., Ltd.
Date of creation: 1908.
Object entry information: This is the latest domestic sewing machine made by the Singer Co., and is an improved form of No. 144. It is a lock-stitch machine, and the stitches are formed by means of a hook, which oscillates below the work plate about a vertical axis and carries the loops of the upper thread around a stationary bobbin containing the under-thread. The needle-bar is actuated by a crank and connecting rod, and, consequently, moves up and down without any intermittent loop-forming motion, while, owing to its not being continued through the top of the machine, the bar is shorter than usual. The take-up mechanism is operated from the same crank as the needle-bar, and the four-motion feed is similar in general features to that employed in the earlier example. An arrangement is provided whereby, when the presser-foot is raised, the upper thread is released from its tension, and, when the under-thread bobbin needs refilling, it is readily removed from its casing by means of a push piece and a lever. The example has been sectioned and mounted upon a stand with a mirror below to render visible all the mechanism employed.

Object entry information: Hemp has been employed for the manufacture of rope and canvas from a very remote period, its use being mentioned by Herodotus, B.C. 450. In the manufacture of rope, the earlier stages by which the hemp is prepared and its fibres straightened out do not possess any general interest, the process chiefly consisting in a prolonged soaking in water and a subsequent drying, breaking and heckling. In making the hemp into rope, the coarseness of the fibres and their great length, about 3 ft., have rendered the advantages of machine over hand work less pronounced than in many industries, so that hemp is still extensively spun by hand, assisted only by the very primitive machines of a rope-walk. The spinner wraps a quantity of prepared hemp round his waist, and then pulling forward a tuft, twists it and attaches it to a hook at one end of the walk. This hook, or whirl, is rapidly rotated through multiplying wheels by an assistant, so twisting the fibres into a yarn, while the spinner walking backward continues to feed more fibres, end on, into the yarn, until he reaches the limit of the walk, sometimes 400 yds. After some minor operations, the completion of the rope is proceeded with by combining three or more of these yarns into a single cord in such a way that there shall be no tendency for the rope to untwist. This process, known as laying, is of great interest, and in a rope-walk is performed by attaching the three strands at one

Object name: ROPE-MAKING MACHINE.
Maker/Donor: Presented by H. Cotton, Esq.
Date of creation: 1874.
Object entry information: This is a machine for laying together as many as 49 strands to form a cotton rope such as is used for driving purposes. The separate bobbins holding the material to be stranded are contained in a stationary creel, from which the strands pass through an eye to the twisting and winding-up machinery. This consists of an open frame that can be rotated round a horizontal axis, through a hollow trunnion at one end the strands enter twisted together into a rope. This rope passes round two friction sheaves, driven at constant speed, and on to a winding drum, which is driven by a friction coupling, so that as the drum fills, increased slipping can take place to allow for the enlarged diameter. The rope is led on to the drum by a fork moved by a cam. The mechanism is all driven by a stationary spur-wheel gearing into a wheel attached to the revolving frame. This machine does not strand in the ordinary way, and to lay a rope that shall not fail in it requires that a definite excess of twist shall be given to the yarn of the individual strands to correct the untwisting done in the machine; stationary creel machines require each bobbin to be mounted in an epicyclic frame if general work is to be done.

Object name: WIRE ROPE MACHINE.
Maker/Donor: Contributed by W. Smith, Esq.
Date of creation: 1872.
Object entry information: This machine, patented by Mr. Andrew Smith in 1849, differs from the earlier machine of Cartwright in that the epicyclic motion of the bobbins is obtained by linkwork instead of gearing, also that it is arranged vertically. It consists of a frame having below a disc-wheel that is driven by bevel gear from a horizontal shaft. Above this disc is attached a revolving cage that carries six bobbins supported in separate frames; above the cage is a seventh bobbin which carries the material for the core of the rope. The cage is not concentric with the lower disc, and the carriers of its bobbins are each provided with a crank arm which fits on a separate pin on the lower disc, so that as the disc is driven these arms pull round the cage, but at the same time prevent the rotation of the bobbin frames, the arrangement being a “parallel-crank” chain. From the bobbins the wires pass over guide sheaves to a lay-top above, then, after being stranded together, over a return sheave they pass to a winding-off sheave below, and are finally wound as a finished rope, on a drum which is driven by a slipping belt so as to be independent of the variation of diameter. The winding-off sheave has three grooves of different diameters, so that the pitch of the strands may be altered. A counter driven by the return sheave records the length of rope made.
